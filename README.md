Assumptions
#concerning the php cli script stored as "phpchar_cli.php" i assumed the API was stored at the same location as the directory of the script 
and  sqlite database.
#concerning the full application I assumed that the user is going to be interacting with the  database directly, so
i created a login page to restrict access to the application making the admin the only one able to access the application.
#i also added little css design to make the app presentable.
